# Portfolio
This is Maxine's public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! Welcome!  
Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 
I am a Data Queen! :)


# About me

Hi!  My name is Maxine, and I am from Swatou, Guangdong, China. 

I speak Mandarin, Teochew language, English, and Korean. Althouth I am from Guangdong, I don't speak Cantonese. (I am currently learning Cantonese on Duolingo App)

I am studying in MISM(Master of Information Systems Management) program at CMU now. Before this, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor degree in Statistics. 

I am a data-driven person. And I love visualization because numbers can be really boring sometimes. Hence, I prefer to use data visualization to deliver my messages and express my opinions. 

If you want to learn more about me, let's connect on Linkedln: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxine-ma-350336138/

Nice to know you! 


# What I hope to learn

1. I hope to become an expert in using data visualization. 
2. I hope to tell perfect stories using data and visualization.   
3. I hope to sharpen my drawing skills. 
4. I want to prepare myself well for my data analytics/data science career after I graduate.
