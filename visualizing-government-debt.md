# Part 1: (OECD) General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio in 2021
This government debt bar chart clearly shows the general government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021 for each country. The countries are ranked by ratio. The OECD-Average ratio is shown in black.

# Part 2: Working with Flourish 
## (Data Visualization I) General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio by Countries
This set of grid of line charts uses the data from 1995 to 2021 to show the general government debt-to GDP ratio for countries in the OECD. In this graph, we can see the trends for the changes of debt-to-GDP ratio for each country during these years. The countries are displayed in an alphabatical order.

## (Data Visualization II) General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio by Countries in Year 1995-2021
Below are two graphs showing the general government debt-to-GDP ratio by countries in year 1995-2021. As what we see from the bar chart from Part 1, Japan, Greece, Italy, and the USA are the four countries which have the highest general government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021. Hence in the following two graphs, I am focusing on analyzing these four countries by showing the trends of ratio changes for them from 1995 to 2021, and compare them with other countries in the same time period. 

For the first graph, I use pie chart to show the audience a sense of comparision with other countries. I use black for Japan as it has the higest ratio in 2021, and black can be a sign of warning; blue for Greece, green for Italy, red for the USA, as those are the colors for these countries' flags.
